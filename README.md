# Load-Prediction-Scaife-Hall
This is aimed at replicating the model developed in a research paper and applying it to Scaife hall Power consumption.
The model developed in the paper, consists of two major features, 
a) A time of week indicator variable and 
b) A piecewise linear and continuous outdoor air temperature dependence.
It consists of two loading conditions, a) Occupied and b) Unoccupied, which are considered at the same time based on occupancy times.
